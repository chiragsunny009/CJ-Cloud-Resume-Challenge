# AWS Cloud Resume Challenge

This is my attempt at cloud resume challenge in AWS. What is Cloud Resume Challenge? - The Cloud Resume Challenge is a multiple-step resume project which helps build and demonstrate skills fundamental to pursuing a career in Cloud. 
The project was published by Forrest Brazeal.

The challenge consists of several chunks and multiple options along the way to choose your own apporach:

Getting Cloud Practitioner Certification.
Resume in HTML/CSS deployed in S3 as a static website.
AWS CloudFront Distribution in front of the S3 bucket.
Custom DNS domain name.
Javascript calling the API and displaying a visitor counter on the website.
API Gateway that accepts requests from your web app and communicates with the database through Lambda function.
Database in DynamoDB to save and update the visitor counter.
Lambda function that updates the database and returns an updated value to API Gateway.
Cypress tests to complete end-to-end testing for your code.
Infrastructure as Code.
CI/CD.
Blog post.
